    "# Introduction\n",
    "Lua is like a set of building blocks, but instead of physical blocks, we have words and symbols that we use to create computer programs. Imagine it like a new language you're learning, but this language helps you talk to a computer and tell it exactly what to do. In Lua, there are 5 important parts that you need to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variables**: Variables are like boxes where you can store anything - pictures of cats, today's date, your favorite quote - anything! We use these boxes to remember things for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decisions**: Just like you might decide what to wear based on the weather, Lua can make decisions too. We can tell Lua that if it's raining in the game, draw an umbrella. If it's sunny, draw sunglasses. This is how Lua makes decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loops**: Remember when we used to sing that song on repeat during car rides? Loops are like the repeat button for a song. If we want Lua to do something over and over, we put it in a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Functions**: Functions are like your favorite recipes. Just like a cake recipe that tells us how to make a cake step by step, a function is a set of instructions that we can use again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tables**: Tables in Lua are like a big cupboard with lots of little drawers. Each drawer can hold different things, and they have labels so we can find what we stored. It's Lua's way of keeping things tidy and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basics of Lua. With these five parts, you can start telling the computer what to do, just like putting together building blocks or following a recipe. Isn't that fun?"

On the left side, we put the name of our box (which is the variable name), and on the right side, we put what we want to store in the box. Here are some examples:"

    "4. Tables: In Lua, tables are like trays with lots of little compartments. You can store different items in each compartment.

    "Dear Grandma, I hope you've enjoyed this little guide to Lua that we've created together, inspired by your love for gardening.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started our journey into Lua with **Variables**, just like labels we put on our plants. We saw how we could store different things, like names of plants or numbers in them, and how to change what's stored if we needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we moved on to **Decisions**, the equivalent of deciding whether to water a plant based on how dry the soil is. We used if and elseif to make decisions and control what Lua does based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we learnt about **Loops**, which are like our daily or weekly gardening routines, repeating tasks over and over for each plant or for a certain amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we covered **Functions**. These are like our special gardening methods, a set of instructions that we can use whenever we need, making our code neat and easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we explored **Tables**, Lua's version of our garden shed. We saw how we can store things in numbered spots, and then how to add labels to these spots using keys for easier access and organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout our exploration, we've seen that Lua, just like gardening, is about organising and managing things so they work together in the best way possible. It's a different world, but with familiar concepts and a beauty of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for accompanying me on this journey, Grandma. Now that you've gotten a taste of how Lua works, maybe you'll find new ways to blend your love of gardening with a bit of coding! Happy Gardening and Happy Coding!"
